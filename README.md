# mys_sweepsy
Solution to take home challenge for Censys
## Problem 
Using Go, write a scanner to detect MySQL running on a port on a host. It should connect to a single port that is running MySQL, and output some information about the MySQL instanceâ€™s configuration. The scanner should detect as much as it can from a single MySQL handshake, without logging in.

## Input
* Host IP Address
* Port Number

## Output
* Whether or not MySQL appears to be running on the port on the host
* Any additional information about the instance of MySQL that it has retrieved

## Usage
`go build` at root level

`./mys_sweepsy $IP $PORT`

Then success or failure to connect to the given IP and port for MySQL will print to the console.

## Test
`go test ./...` will test the process for building the connection string, validates failures when IP or Port are not acceptable.
